# ðŸ’» Postman v2 API FAQ

1. **Can I share the API docs link with my vendors?**
   * Yes, please do so. The API docs are hosted on the Internet.
2. **Currently, we do API post with long SMS text content. Our SMS vendor will automatically split the message into several SMS messages to the end user. Is Postman the same?**
   * For long message content, it will be combined and will appear as a single message to the user.
