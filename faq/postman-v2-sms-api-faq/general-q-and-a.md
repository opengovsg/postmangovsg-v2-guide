# General Q\&A

1.  **Can I share the API docs link with my vendors?**

    * Yes, you may share this link with your vendors: [https://postman-v2.guides.gov.sg/](https://postman-v2.guides.gov.sg/)


2.  **Currently, we do API post with long SMS text content. Our SMS vendor will automatically split the message into several SMS messages to the end user. Is Postman the same?**

    * For long message content, it will be combined and will appear as a long message to the user.

    * No, but the team will be considering this point.


4. **How do I reach out if I have any issues with my API integration or questions regarding the documents?**
   * Please fill up our [contact us form](https://form.gov.sg/admin/form/64a535b829d2650012a9938b), we aim to get back to you in 5 working days.
