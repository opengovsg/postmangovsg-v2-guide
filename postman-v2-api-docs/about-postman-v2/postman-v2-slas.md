# Postman v2 SLAs

### 1. **What is Postman v2’s uptime?**

* Postman aims to have an uptime of >99.5%. We have internal services to monitor Postman uptime 24/7. These services send alerts if the product is down to the engineer-on-call, so that we can respond as soon as possible.
* If you are unable to access Postman services and would like to check if it is due to an unplanned downtime, check our status page [here](https://status.postman.gov.sg/).

### 2. **Any maintenance downtime for Postman v2?**

* No, we will inform all users if there is going to be a scheduled downtime.

### 3. **How long can I expect a reply for my queries?**

* We will get back to you on your [form](https://form.gov.sg/657025a2d2bd350012c82eb0) submissions within **5** working days.
* Please ensure your requests are submitted via this form, rather than through emailing the team, as emails are likely to be missed during this time.

### 4. **What’s the SMS throughput rate?**

* We have a WOG throughput rate that is not agency specific. Be rest assured that we can handle the load. SMSes are expected to be sent almost immediately, or up to 3-5 minutes if there are many in the queue from WOG.
* Please use this testing period to ensure that your systems are similarly able to handle the load before calling Postman’s API.
* If you would like to do load testing, please let us know in advance so we can schedule a specific date and time in May
