# ðŸªµ Message Logs

In the campaign dashboard, there are 2 categories:

1. [Messages](message-logs.md#messages)
2. [Batches](message-logs.md#batches)

### Messages

Messages consists of all messages that you have sent out in a single campaign.&#x20;

Messages may be sent out as a single message, or can be part of a batch of messages. You may identify this through the `Job Type` column in the campaign dashboard.

_(Please ignore the details under From column.)_

You will then receive the logs in your email, and you may filter out the required logs you will need using excel.

Each message will have its own message ID, this message ID can be found in the message logs that you download.&#x20;

### Batches

A batch consists of multiple messages that are sent out at the same time. Each batch will come with its own Batch ID, and each batch can be downloaded by clicking on the <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-02-26 at 2.54.22 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon tagged to each batch.&#x20;
