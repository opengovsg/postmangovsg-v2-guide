#### **Singpass login**

{% hint style="info" %}
Singpass login is only available for users with a`.gov.sg` email address and have their details stored within [POCDEX](https://docs.id.gov.sg/faq-users) by their HR. If you are unable to login via SingPass, please switch to [Email login](logging-into-postman-v2.md#email-login) instead.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you have selected SingPass login, you will be taken to the SingPass login page.&#x20;

For officers with more than 1 official `gov.sg` email address belonging to different agencies, you will be able to select which agency you wish to log in with.
