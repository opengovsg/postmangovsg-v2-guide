# ðŸ¤– About Postman v2

The Postman team is currently rebuilding Postman (v2) for sending out SMS-es.

## SMS API users

The Postman team is currently rebuilding Postman (v2) for sending out SMS-es, where the infrastructure and user interface of the platform will be very different. Our staging platform will be up by the end of December 2023, where agencies can test out the new platform and obtain API keys needed for testing.

## Test Platform

{% hint style="info" %}
The test site is **only** meant for API users.\
\
If you are an admin portal user that does not require any system integration, you **should not** be testing our platform.\
\
Admin Portal users can only start testing in **Feb 2024**, more details will be released in due course.
{% endhint %}

Our test platform is now live, you may access it through this link [https://test.postman.gov.sg](https://test.postman.gov.sg)
