# Summary of Costs

Using the Postman platform itself to send the SMSes are **free**.

However, there are 2 other costs that will need to be borne by agencies:

1. **Sender ID registration costs (IMDA)**
   * This is charged by IMDA for the registration and maintenance of your sender ID, which is a nation-wide regulation.
   * Total costs - one-time set-up fee of $500 per organisation + $200 annually per sender ID.
   * This is charged regardless of which aggregator you use.
