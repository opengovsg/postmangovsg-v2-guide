# 5. Send a Test Message on Twilio

Note that this step is done in Twilio, not Postman, yet.

Navigate back to the console and under **Try it out**, select **Send an SMS.** Insert your own phone number and select the messaging service that you set up earlier in step 4.

Type your message and click send to check if you receive the SMS and if the Sender ID is accurate.

**If you encounter an error with sending a test SMS**, it is likely that the Sender ID has yet to be mapped to Twilio. You may reach out to us so that we can link you up with our Twilio account manager.

**If you don't receive your test SMS**, it is likely that this Sender ID has been taken by another agency. You should use the Alphanumeric Sender ID that you have registered with SGNIC in this field.
