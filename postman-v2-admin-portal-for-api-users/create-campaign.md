### Available channels for campaign creation

Postman has 2 types of campaign channels available - **Member of Public** and **Internal Staff**

1. Member of Public: To send out messages to MOPs
2. Internal Staff - to send out with your own sender ID
   * You will need to provide your own Twilio credentials if you choose the `Internal Staff` option

{% hint style="info" %}
All messages sent out to MOPs via the `Members of Public` option will come from the `Postman`sender ID.
{% endhint %}

#### Temporary Sender Name (mid-April 2024 to launch)

Postman will be ready for use from mid-April 2024.&#x20;

Users will be able to use WOG Sender IDs that their agencies registered with SGNIC thus far. The sender IDs will appear as options under the `Select temporary sender name` field.

In the example below, the available sender IDs that the user's agency registered are `Government Technology Agency` and `Open Government Products`. The user will not be able to see other sender IDs registered by other agencies.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you send a message with exact same content to the same person multiple times in 1 sitting in the same campaign:

For example, the message "Hi your appointment is on 1 Jan 2024" was sent to Tom 10 times within 1 batch send.

The telcos' automatic spam filter may be triggered . This means the message may not be delivered  to Tom's phone at all, even though it will pass Postmanâ€™s send filters and status is reflected as `delivered`.  See screenshot below on how the batch .csv is formatted in this failed example.
