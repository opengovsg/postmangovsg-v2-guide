#### Temporary Sender Name (mid-April 2024 to launch)

Postman will be ready for use from mid-April 2024.&#x20;

Users will be able to use WOG Sender IDs that their agency have been registered with SGNIC thus far. The sender IDs will appear as options under the `Select temporary sender name` field.



In the example below, the available sender IDs that the user's agency has registered are `Government Technolocy Agency` and `Open Government Products`. The user willl not be able to see other sender IDs registered by other agencies.&#x20;
