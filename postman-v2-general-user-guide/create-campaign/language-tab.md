   * eg. If you select Malay as your `language`, you should input your message **in Malay** into the message body field; messages will not be translated for you.
2. SMS Header
   * SMS header will always remain in English.
3. SMS Footer
   * The SMS Footer of each message changes with the `language` selected.
   * eg. If you select Malay as your `language,` the SMS footer will change to Malay.
