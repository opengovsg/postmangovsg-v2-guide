# âš™ Campaign Settings

You will be able to obtain your campaign API keys and whitelist your IP address from your campaign's `settings` page, under the `integrations` tab. This part will be accessible after you have [created](create-campaign.md) and saved your campaign.&#x20;

### IP address whitelisting

Provide your IP address for whitelisting. You will be able to provide up to 10 IP addresses.

### API keys

You will only be able to obtain your API keys **after** you have whitelisted your IP address.&#x20;

One campaign can have up to 3 API keys.

#### Do API keys have an expiry?&#x20;

The API keys have no expiry.&#x20;

If you need to obtain a new API key, you can simply delete the old key and generate a new key.&#x20;
